# Project-SQL-Injection
In this project, I used SQLMap to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application. 
My steps included:
Testing SQL Injection Vulnerabilities – Using SQLMap, I tested a URL for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing various parameters.

Automated Data Extraction – With SQLMap flags like -dbs, -D, and --tables, I retrieved information about databases and tables.

Data Dumping – Using the --dump flag, I extracted data from the database tables, including user information and passwords.

Practical Testing – By testing a vulnerable login page, I used SQLMap to extract data from the database, successfully applying various flags and parameters.

Achievements in this project:
Detected SQL injection vulnerability on a web page.
Retrieved all databases and tables using SQLMap.
Extracted sensitive data, including user passwords.
Applied various SQLMap flags and parameters to automate the exploitation process.
As a result, I successfully demonstrated how to use SQLMap for testing and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
